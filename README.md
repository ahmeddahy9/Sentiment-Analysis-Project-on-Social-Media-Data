# 💬 Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data

## 📋 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing and classifying sentiments** (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) from **social media text data** using machine learning models.  
We clean and preprocess user-generated text, apply **TF-IDF vectorization**, manage **class imbalance** with **SMOTE**, and train models such as:
- 🧠 Logistic Regression  
- 🌲 Random Forest  
- 🔍 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we explore the dataset to understand its content, sentiment distribution, and text characteristics.

### ✅ Steps:
- Show basic dataset information and descriptive statistics  
- Visualize sentiment class distribution  
- Analyze text length, word frequency, and most common words per sentiment  
- Check for missing or duplicate entries  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To develop an efficient model that can **automatically detect user sentiment** from text posts, helping businesses and researchers understand public opinion at scale.
